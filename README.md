## Overview

### The project

The Learning Journal webpage allows users to do/see following:

- View a "home" page with a link to one "recent article" which is clickable
- View a "recent article" page
- View a "about me" page
- View a "contacts" page with clickable links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Instagram accounts
- View and use "burger" menu icon when viewport is 560px and smaller
- The layout is fully responsive!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS pseudoclasses
- Flexbox
- GRID
- Mobile first design
- Multiple pages design
- Accessibility focus design
- Responsive design
- Relative units
- Media queries
- Viewport meta tags

### What I learned

...

### Continued development

In future I would like to fill the page with my own original contant. Pictures and texts are going to be authentic and personal. With that I would like to add more articles which would be accessible (there will be a link on them). Next thing would be finishing the "View more" button, which is already prepared, but I need more time to finishing all the styling and javascript code.
